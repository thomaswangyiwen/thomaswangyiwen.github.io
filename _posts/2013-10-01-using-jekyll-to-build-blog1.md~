#Some Tips for using Jekyll

Generally speaking, I followed most of Jekyll-Bootstrap's tutorial. But there are some modification needed to adopt while installing the Jekyll-based blog.
Before we start, I have to say that:
+ I don't want to write something that other people have already written on their pages.
+ I just want to write a summary or memo for my late review. So this is not a pure toturial.

Oh, and I want to reclaim my computer environment. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (debian-based) as my default desktop environment.

Okay, let's do this.

###Setting the environment for Jekyll

Briefly, we need :
+ruby
+bundler(if necessary)
+rubyGem
+a well-set repository named USERNAME.github.io
+Jekyll

As for the local testing, please do remember that the latest Jekyll (version 1.2.1) I use is no longer support following commander:

    sudo jekyll --serve

Instead, the jekyll officially change the commander to this:

    sudo jekyll serve

###Creating the new pages and posts

   (I will finish this in the following days)
