This article is about building a blog on the github. 
Generally, I followed the steps of jekyll-bootstrap. However with the advent of latest jekyll, there are several minor modifications needed to adopt during the deployment of whole system.

#Installing jekyll and running the website in the local environment

First, create a repository named USERNAME.github.io.
 according to the official site, you must use the format mentioned above or the website will not work out. Remember, this is something that you should pay attention on.

Second, clone the git of jekyll bootstrap into the local file.
