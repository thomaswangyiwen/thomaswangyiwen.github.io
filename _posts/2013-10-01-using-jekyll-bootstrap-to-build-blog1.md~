#Some Tips for using Jekyll

Generally speaking, I followed most of Jekyll-Bootstrap's tutorial. But there are some modifications needed to adopt while installing the Jekyll-based blog.
Before we start, I have to say that:

+ I just want to mainly write a summary or memo for my late review. So this is not a pure toturial.

Oh, and here I want to reclaim my computer environment. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (debian-based) as my default desktop environment.

Okay, let's do this.

###Setting the environment for Jekyll

Briefly, we need :
+ ruby
+ bundler(if necessary)
+ rubyGem
+ a well-set repository named USERNAME.github.io
+ Jekyll

As for the local testing, please do remember that the latest Jekyll (version 1.2.1) I use is no longer support the following command:

    sudo jekyll --serve

Instead, the jekyll has officially changed the commander to this:

    sudo jekyll serve

###Creating the new pages and posts

   (I will finish this in the following days)
   
create a new post:

    rake post title="new post"

create a new page:

    rake page name="about.md"
   
I do believe these commands are quite self-explanatory.
   

###updates your repository

anyway, here I will use a few words to tell you how to update your repository to the latest version without conservation of your history version.

Every time you modify something in your local repository, you may want to apply this change to your remote repository on the github. Run this:

    git add -u .

    git commit -m "ANYMSG YOU LIKE"

    git push origin master
