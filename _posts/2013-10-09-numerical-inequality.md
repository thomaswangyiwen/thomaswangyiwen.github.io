This post is about inequality. I am about to review some important inequality techniques more frequently used in the mathematical competitions and researches. However, I will not let the post get too nerdy and brief. There will be a lot of hints and indications on how to apply such techniques, on how these methods are triggued. Also, it is about the structure of math. I will choose a proper way to construct everything step by step.

##Foundations of Inequality
I decide to have the foundation of inequality built on existence of the real number system and set theory. Although building everything from the ground up sounds pretty cool and concrete, namely from integers to rational numbers and then the real number system, yet I don't think I have that much time to include those stuff, especially when we are talking about the Inequality, not about the best way to build a system.

To begin with, we have to confess that the inequality comes from the order of a set. Without order, it is meaningless to compare the elements selected from a given set.

Here are some basic properties we rely on for our further exploration.

$$ property\ 1:\ a\ real\ number\ x\ must\ satisfy\ one\ of\ the\ following\\ three\ conditions: $$

$$(1)x=0;$$

$$(2)x\in P;$$

$$(3)-x\in P;$$

*property 2:*

You may ask "why set theory"? Well, the answer is I think set theory is quite convenient for one to cultivate oneself to use so-called "deduction" or "abstract thinking" or whatever. Some mathematicians find this kind of thinking quite beautiful and concrete, and actually accept it as an essence or a truth, of the world, yet I cannot agree on that. Personally,I see it as a branch of art of mathematics. It is an art, not a fundamental rule that reflects more mystery of our world or sth like that. (Some day I will give my explanation in another post) But, you cannot deny the fact that deduction is really neat and efficient for solving some problems that are quite unintuitive and hard to understand directly.

##Methods of proof

Following ideas that you should always keep in mind for they can save you from losing yourself and getting lost in bunches of math techniques:

+ change the unfamilar one to what you have already known 

+ resort to the definition

+ specific cases can be generalized into a larger group of problems and thus can be solved on a larger scale by a generalized method

+ try to find connections of two irrelavent things by resorting to a third 

####Logical deduction
This is a perfect method for separate a very tough and twsited problem into many subproblem easier to solve. The most amazing part of deduction is that every step of transformation conducted by laws of logic is ensured to be true. We don't need to pay too much attention on how we think or what matters most in any specific problem. 
uik
The core of this method is to understand the basic laws of logic and how to transform a problem into its equivalent problem.
