Recently I have been reviewing some skills in mental arithmetics. I do believe that this kind of skills lead to shaping a basic foundation of an acumen in mathematics, which is required for my further study in logics and mathematics.

Anyway, I will explain this kind of issue in another post, not here. I will talk about some tricks to do mental maths. 

##The very first rule of mental math
As a key to the mental calculation, decomposition of a hard problem into many easy-to-do subproblems is the only choice one can have. After you get familiar with ways of "decompositions", practice them many times so that your brain will get used to them. Remember, you have to decompose a very ugly calculating process before you really begin to do it.

Generally speaking, there are no magic tricks which can immediately save your time and efforts for doing arithmetics mentally without heavy practice, after all, what you want to do is of math, a serious subject. What we are talking about is to fully utilize your limited brain resources to finish a complicated task without losing your attention in a storm of numbers and operators.




##1.Addtion and Reduction

####Do it one digit at a time


##2.Multiplication and Division
As for product and division, there is a little prerequisite--you need to recite every value of product between digits and digits from 0 to 9.

####2.0 two-by-two digits multiplication by addition method
rule: break up the larger number of the two.
The reason is quite simple. try this:
	
	74 * 13

For me, and I think it also will work for you : it's better first stablize the digit in the higher postion so that you won't modify this digit in the next calculation process. You will see what I mean if you compare the process of following two: 

	( 70 + 4 ) * 13 = 910 + 52 = 962

	( 10 + 3 ) * 74 = 740 + 222 = 962 ( worse one )

exception rule:
+ when you make multiply a number in 50s, you may find that it's easier to break up 50s  

####2.1 two-by-two digits multiplication by subtraction method
rule: using complements
For example, using the complement of 59

	67 * 59 = 67 * ( 60 - 1) = 4020 - 67 = 3953

As for ( 4020 - 67 ), taking full advantage of complements, it also can be calculated in this way:

	67 - 20 = 47
	100 - 47 = 53
	3900 + 53 = 3953

####2.2 Factoring method
rule: using the larger factor first.
You will get it when you look at the example below:

	52 * 33 = 52 * 11 * 3 = 572 * 3 = 1716

another one:

	67 * 42 = 67 * 6 * 7 = 402 * 7 = 1932

In this eg, we use the factor 6 first, rather than 7 because of existence of friendly products, whose digit in the middle is 0. Here are some friendly products:

	12 * 9 = 108
	13 * 8 = 104
	15 * 7 = 105
	17 * 6 = 102
	18 * 6 = 108
	21 * 5 = 105
	23 * 9 = 207
	25 * 4 = 100
	25 * 8 = 200
	26 * 4 = 104
	26 * 8 = 208
	...etc.
