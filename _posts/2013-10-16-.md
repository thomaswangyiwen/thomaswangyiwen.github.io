###sublime Installation

First, go to download the [Sublime_Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com "sublime"). This editor is quite useful and efficient for writing codes. After you end with your downloaded file, squiz them out into any file you like. I prefer to make a new file named "sublime2" in the "~/":

	cd ~/ && mkdir sublime2

Then copy everything from the tar file you downloaded. try sublime2 now:

	cd sublime2 && ./sublime_text

It should work smoothly or you may have download the wrong edition that doesn't match your operating system. Here, I have to say that I am a ubuntu user and for ubuntu users' convenience (Other Linux users likewise), it's better to set an alias name so as to directly run sublime2 in the terminal or you will get crazy when you attempt to run the editor for you need to first get yourself in the /sublime2 before you have the chance to get it run. In short, just follow the following code for your own goodness:

	cd ~/ && sudo emacs .bashrc -nw

Anyway, I am also a fan of emacs. If you are vi fanatics, ..good luck(change the above "emacs" to "vi" or "vim"). Now at the bottom of the .bashrc file, add a line of code:

	alias sublime="~/sublime2/sublime_text"

Save what you add to the file and try "sublime" in the terminal. sublime should show up smoothly again.
